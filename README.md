# ExitLag Setup Guide

## 📌 What is ExitLag?

**ExitLag** is a connection optimization tool designed for gamers. It reduces **ping**, prevents **packet loss**, and stabilizes **internet connections** by routing game traffic through the fastest and most reliable paths using its global server network. ExitLag is especially useful when playing on foreign servers or when experiencing unstable routing from your ISP.

## ⚙️ How Does ExitLag Work?

ExitLag uses a technology called **multi-path routing**, which sends your game data simultaneously through multiple optimized routes. The system dynamically selects the best-performing path in real time to ensure:

- ✅ Lower ping  
- ✅ Fewer disconnections  
- ✅ Stable and consistent gameplay  
- ✅ Improved routing to servers worldwide  

> Unlike VPNs, ExitLag does **not** encrypt your traffic or hide your IP — its sole purpose is performance optimization.
